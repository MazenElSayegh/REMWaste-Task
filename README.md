## 🎨 Design Change Approach

### 📝 Original Design Overview

* 🏷️ The original page is part of the product ordering process. It displays a list of products, allows users to select and view product details, and includes a progress bar indicating the current stage.

### 🎯 Goals of the Redesign

* ✅ Improve usability, enhance visual appeal, and ensure full responsiveness across devices (UI/UX improvements).

### 🔧 Approach Taken

* 🔍 I began by reviewing the original layout to identify usability pain points, particularly on smaller screens.
* 🛠️ I used modern front-end tools and frameworks such as \[React + Vite, Bootstrap, etc.], focusing on component-based design.
* 🧩 The layout was restructured to separate key sections: product listing, product details, and progress bar. This modular approach improved maintainability and readability.
* ✨ I introduced cleaner UI elements, improved spacing, and modern icons to create a more intuitive and engaging experience.
* 📱 To enhance responsiveness and accessibility, I applied a mobile-first design strategy, implemented flexible grid systems, and ensured screen reader compatibility where applicable.

### 🚧 Challenges and Solutions

* ⚙️ The progress bar was poorly displayed in the mobile view.
* 🧠 I resolved this by replacing the traditional horizontal progress bar with a fixed sidebar that uses intuitive icons, making it easier for mobile users to navigate through steps.

### 🎉 Outcome

* 📊 The redesigned page is significantly more user-friendly, visually appealing, and responsive across devices compared to the original.
